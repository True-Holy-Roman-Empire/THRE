#New Theocratic governments for THRE
#Reason for adding is that we want to have Theocratic Free Cities
#Coded by Micha 'Mepper' Helder for the 2023 EU4 Moddaton

#Localisation for these new Governments can be found in localisation\THRE_Governments_l_english.yml
#When adding new Government Reforms make sure to add them in common\governments\00_governments.txt! If you skip this step the Government Reforms selection screen in-game will get messed up.
