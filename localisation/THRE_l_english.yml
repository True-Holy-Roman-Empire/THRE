      TRUE_HRE_CAMPAIGN_NAME: "The True Holy Roman Empire"
      TRUE_HRE_CAMPAIGN_DESC: "History was forever changed when emperor Charlemagne, king of the Franks, married empress Irene of Constantinople. The formal alliance between the Franks and Byzantines culminated not long after in the merging of their Empires as the Holy Roman Empire. Long has it stood strong, but after the devastation of the Mongol invasions in Central Asia religious tensions rose as many Muslims fled into the Empire. Threatened with Civil Unrest due to religious tensions, in 1356 Emperor Constantine XIV gathered representatives of all major religions in his Empire in Constantinople. Within a year he was able to proclaim religious freedom, equality and tolerance for all his subjects who followed one of the Abrahamic religions.  \nAlmost a hundred years of relative peace later, in the year 1444, the vast yet decentralized Empire stands at a precipice."
